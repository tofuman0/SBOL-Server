# Shutokou Battle Online Server
## Overview
Fans of the Toyko Xtreme Racer Series may not be aware that back in 2003-2005 Genki released an online PC version of the game. However this was only available to Japan.

As the game wasn't popular outside of Japan it seems that absolutely no documentation was made of how the game worked or any packet logs of the game were made. I reverse engineered the network protocol and have created a server that people are free to play on. It isn't quite 100% functional but playable.
